It is issued in�advance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 75N94023R00010 entitled, �Preclinical Medications�Screening in Dependence, Affect and Pain Models of Alcoholism� and is being issued on behalf of the�National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) by the National Institute of Child�Health and Human Development (NICHD), Office of Acquisitions, NIH, DHHS. THIS IS A PRESOLICIATION NOTICE ISSUED IN ADVANCE OF THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THIS IS A RESEARCH�AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) CONTRACT REQUIREMENT and is NOT an NIH grant opportunity. Description: NIAAA supports a preclinical medication efficacy testing program to foster validation of medication�targets and discovery of lead compounds relevant to AUD therapeutics. The current contract,�HHSN275201800006C, with the Louisiana State University Health Science Center (LSUHSC) was awarded�in 2018 as a one-year base contract with four (4) 12-month option periods. It supports medication�testing on measures of alcohol drinking, negative affect, and pain using in the chronic�intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure model in rats and expires September 26, 2023. To address the present and anticipated future needs of NIAAA�s Medication Development Program, the�LSUSC contract is being recompeted to continue supporting work within the same scope, i.e.,�medication testing in rats using the CIE model and alcohol drinking, pain, and negative affect�measures. It will implement the testing capacity of 2-3 compounds per year over the next five�years. The contract will use mechanisms having intellectual property conditions favorable to�compound providers when acquiring compounds from industry. This will eliminate a major barrier to�testing optimized compounds and will stimulate interest by the pharmaceutical industry in�developing high quality, marketable compounds for alcoholism. The data generated will be used in� the identification of compounds for further development. The requirements within this statement of work (in attached SOW) are considered severable for the�base and each 12-month option period. The goals of the proposed contract are: � �To assess compounds effects in standardized models of elevated alcohol intake in rats exposed to�chronic intermittent ethanol. � �To assess compound effects on negative affect and pain measures in alcohol dependent�rats. � �To collect, analyze, and display test data and report them to designated NIAAA� personnel. Animal Care and Use: The Offeror shall establish and provide resources for an animal care and use�program that is managed in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and�regulations, such as: � �Animal Welfare Regulations (9 CFR, 1985/1989)� https://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/final-rules-animal-welfare-9-cfr-parts-1-2-and-3 � �Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 8th ed., National Research Council,�2011 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54050/ Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, revised 2015. https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm. To demonstrate compliance with the above policies and guidance, Offerors shall submit with their�Technical Proposal: 1) a copy of your organization�s most recent letter from NIH�s Office of�Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) documenting approval of a valid Animal Welfare Assurance, and 2) a�copy of your organization�s most recent USDA Animal Welfare Act registration certificate. The solicitation is anticipated to result in a single cost-reimbursement contract award. The�duration of the contract will be a one-year base period, with four subsequent one-year option�periods, for a total period of performance of five years. Award is anticipated on or about September 27, 2023. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541715, Research & Development (R&D) in the Physical,�Engineering, and Life Sciences, which has a size standard of 1,000 employees. THIS ACQUISTION IS�UNRESTRICTED (NOT A SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES). Place of Performance: The place of performance will be the Contractor�s work site. Set Aside Status: None.

There are 57 buildings at American Lake Division and 41 buildings at Seattle Division, plus one at the Magnolia Campus and 5 residential homes in the region. Many buildings have some friable/assumed asbestos in crawl spaces, basements, and other maintenance areas. There is a small amount of previously identified damaged non-friable ACM. Ensure all asbestos warning labeling meets AHERA and ASHERA requirements (immediately adjacent to any friable, non-friable ACM and assumed ACM in routine maintenance areas). Provide appropriate labels where needed. Update the physical assessment spreadsheet(s) with any items that were found changed or removed during visual surveillance, annotate these changes in the Comments column of the physical assessment spreadsheet(s). Conduct sampling of specified suspect or assumed materials not previously sampled (no more than 10 samples per inspection) during each surveillance visit. Initial visual surveillance will require many previously identified items, including friable and non-friable items--about 600 items--to be classified in the physical assessment worksheet for the below classifications. The ACM items missing these classifications in the physical assessment are typically listed on the last worksheet for each building s physical assessment, and typically include exterior, roof or other locations not accessed by the previous survey. Note that much of this information can be found in the 2010 asbestos survey reports which will be made available to the Contractor and will normally not require re-inspection for the non-asbestos-containing materials. When an updates asbestos survey report for a give n building is provided, the physical assessment spreadsheet used for this contract will be updated based on the updated survey. Each ACM item will be classified for: Material Description HAS # ACM Friability Assumed/Sampled Division or Campus Building Floor Room Location Units Measured quantity Condition Damage potential Damage type (not required for non-friable) Other damage (not required for non-friable) Damage Accessible Accessibility Potential for personal exposure Potential for air erosion disturbance Recommended Response Action (friable/assumed ACM and previously identified non-friable ACM as damaged only) Disturbance potential (erosion, vibration, traffic, personnel) Priority AHERA Physical Assessment (friable/assumed ACM only): Damage or significant damage to TSI Damaged friable surfacing Significantly damaged friable surfacing Damaged and significantly damaged friable miscellaneous ACBM with potential for damage ACBM with potential for significant damage Recommended Response Action (for all friable/assumed ACM and previously identified damaged non-friable ACM only) Comments The most recent physical assessment spreadsheet for all buildings will be made available. Highlight all friable ACM and previously identified damaged non-friable ACM in the physical assessment spreadsheets (i.e., yellow for damaged non-friable ACM and orange for all friable ACM). Provide a summary spreadsheet that includes all friable/assumed ACM and previously identified damaged non-friable ACM (must include building and campus identification for each item); this spreadsheet must also be updated after each visual inspection, and the update provided to the COR. task two Seattle & Tacoma Divisions Update LBP (Once a Year) Consultant will provide WA State Certified Lead Risk Assessor services supported by CPIH (WA State Certified Lead Inspectors) for field work to accomplish a review of the existing Lead Paint Program, including: Senior WA State Lead Inspectors will update or accomplish the lead survey, and will update the existing Excel spreadsheet inventory for presence, quantity, location, condition of Lead-containing Paint (LCP); The WA State Certified Lead Risk Assessor will conduct the annual physical assessment of all Lead-containing Paint (LCP)/LBP present in the childcare center and residence units at the Tacoma Campus (American Lake) and other off-campus residence units owned by VA Puget Sound.

Task 3 VA Seattle & Tacoma Divisions Haz Drug Wipe Samples (Twice a Year): Contractor will conduct ISO <800> Drug Wipe sampling: Contractor will conduct scheduled surface wipe sampling for hazardous drugs within the Pharmacy and other areas to meet requirements of ISO <800>, and to further investigate contamination and methods in other areas where hazardous drugs are handled and administered. Surface wipe sampling for cisplatin and paroxetine or mitomycin at up to 18 locations, some within the Pharmacy at the VA Seattle and/or VA Tacoma campus, and some in other areas. In the Pharmacy, one sample would be collected from the compounding/mixing area, one sample would be collected from the floor in the close proximity to the compounding/mixing area. If feasible, sampling will be conducted for three (3) occasions, specifically: (a) Prior to compounding/mixing of these chemicals in the pharmacy, (b) Immediately following compounding/mixing these chemicals in the pharmacy, and (c) After standard cleanup techniques have been accomplished in the area where the chemicals were compounded/mixed. This method would aim to confirm that there was no residual chemicals prior to mixing, identify any ""spills/splashes"" immediately following compounding/mixing, and confirm that if there were any ""spills/splashes"", that current standard cleaning techniques neutralized or removed any residual. Results of sample analysis will be compared to the laboratory limit of quantitation and reported in micrograms per 100 square centimeters (µg/100 cm2). Some of these chemicals are identified as potential human carcinogens, and there are no OSHA permissible exposure limits or NIOSH/ACGIH recommended exposure limits for either of these chemicals. NIOSH recommends the ""lowest achievable exposure"". Therefore, consultant recommendations will be based on any detectable quantities above the laboratory quantitation limit. Consultant will prepare a brief written report summarizing the observed work and site conditions, sampling methodologies, analytical results compared against any detection above the laboratory quantitation limit, and conclusions and recommendations. Task 4 Seattle & Tacoma Divisions Non-Ionizing Radiation: Electro-Magnetic Radiation, Radon, RF, UV lights (Estimate-Once Every Two Years) CPIH s inspection of up to five (5) VA PSHCS identified areas at each of the Seattle and Tacoma (American Lake) Campuses (total 10 spaces), including access controls and signage to confirm they are in conformance with the current RF Protection Plan, with ACGIH TLVs, with industry standards and with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) standards for microwave towers.

CPIH will accomplish up to ten (10) sampling episodes in support of quantitative worker exposure assessments (EA) at the Seattle and American Lake Campuses (20 workers total), for comparison to OSHA exposure limits and ACGIH TLVs (e.g., ALs, PELs, and Ceiling Limits) Worker EA sampling and ambient air monitoring will be accomplished in accordance with the accepted analytical method (e.g., NIOSH, OSHA, EPA, etc.); Sampling for exposure assessment and/or ambient evaluations will vary based on sampling media, turn around-time (TAT) and analytical method used, Consultant will prepare a written report, summarizing the observed work activities and site conditions, and providing the data results in tabular format within the report. Task 7 Hazardous Materials Abatement Oversight (15 to 20 Times a Year): Response must be on-call, 24-hour response time The CPIH , under the direction of the CCIH, will perform the necessary monitoring, inspection, testing, and other support services to ensure that VA patients, employees, and visitors will not be adversely affected by asbestos abatement work, and that the abatement work proceeds in accordance with the specifications, that the abated areas or abated buildings have been successfully cleared with satisfactory 3rd party final visual inspections and post abatement Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM) air sampling. The VA Professional Industrial Hygienist (VPIH) or VA COR, shall inspect and oversee the performance of the CCIH or their onsite CPIH as frequently as necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable requirements of the contract.

This new solution will require installation, implementation, project management, training, support, and licenses. The VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS) is seeking for a new nuclear medicine post processing solution for Radiology at Mather and Martinez, California. The Government needs better centralization and standardization of the disparate post-processing applications which are currently in use within the Nuclear Medicine department. Currently, there are multiple applications used for different purposes by the technicians and physicians for Oncology PET/CT and general Nuclear Medicine (cardiac quantification, neuro quantification, renal, bones, MUGA- Multigated Acquisition Scan, etc.). This project is designed to consolidate everything to a single application, single support contract, and break the current OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) cycle of having to repurchase vendor specific/non-agnostic applications and other applications every 3-5 years when they become end-of-life/end-of-support. Therefore, this solution should be and should remain the vendor-neutral solution for post-processing. A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached. If you believe that your company is capable and authorized to perform these services in accordance with the SOW, please provide your information and capability along with an authorization letter from MIM Software, Inc., by responding to pablo.cunanan@va.gov no later than June 14, 2023, by 4 p.m. PDT. The applicable NAICS Code is 513210, Software Publishers, size standard $47.0Million. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No telephone calls will be entertained. See attached document: Draft SOW and Attachment to the SOW entitled Recommended Nuclear Medicine Configuration."
